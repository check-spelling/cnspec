**Open source, cloud-native security and policy project**

`cnspec` is a cloud-native solution to assess the security and compliance of your business-critical infrastructure. `cnspec` finds vulnerabilities and misconfigurations on all systems in your infrastructure including: public and private cloud environments, Kubernetes clusters, containers, container registries, servers, and endpoints, SaaS products, infrastructure as code, APIs, and more.

`cnspec` is a powerful Policy as Code engine built on [`cnquery`](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnquery), and comes configured with default security policies that run right out of the box. It's both fast and simple to use!
